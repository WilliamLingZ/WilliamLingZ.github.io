				<h1>Lakes</h1>
				<p id = "text">Many lakes in the Kananaskis Region are large, deep and nested
				between mountains. In addition they are home to several species of fish which typically
				feed at dawn or dusk. As a result Kananaskis Country lakes can make good locations for
				fishing trips as during the early morning and late afternoon catches are frequent. The time
				in between can be spent hiking or admiring scenery.</p>
