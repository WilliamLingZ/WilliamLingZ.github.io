				<h1>Mountains</h1>
				<p id = "text">The mountains of Kananaskis Country are very close to each other and many
				of them chain together to make large ranges of high altitude terrain. As a result 
				climbing to their peaks can result in very rewarding views. Many different forms of
				wildlife live within the valleys and peaks of these mountains, including bears, squirrels, 
				deer, and various birds.</p>
