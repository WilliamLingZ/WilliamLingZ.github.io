						<th>Kananaskis Country is home to a large number of mountains and ridges.
						Exploring them all will take even the most experienced mountaineers a significant
						amount of time. Along the way you will encounter a large amount of wildlife and
						spectacular views. Click the Mountains tab to learn more.</th>
						<th>In addition to mountains, Kananaskis Country is also home to several large
						lakes. These lakes are typically nested between the numerous mountains and can
						become spectacular views if you are willing to take the time to climb them. In
						addition they house numerous species of fish. Click the Lakes tab to learn more.</th>
						<th>Between the mountains, forests, and lakes there are plenty of vast meadows.
						While they do not stretch as far as the eye can see as they are typically stopped
						off by mountains or lakes, they still provide nice unobstructed views of the
						surrounding landscape. Click the Meadows tab to learn more.</th>
